- 👋 Hi, I’m @adzapala.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science (informatics, computer engineering), especially programming, computer networks, number theory and cryptology. Besides this I'm interested in astronomy, cosmonautics and space engineering. I like play basketball fa-basketball ;-)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning artificial intelligence: machine learning, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch and Scikit-Learn Python libraries.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Python, C/C++ or PHP, JavaScript project. I will be happy if the project will relevant in astronomy, comsonautics or space engineering.
- 📫 You can reach me here, on GitHub.
